\title{Apply spatial smoothing to variables using hexagonal grid topology}
\usage{
smooth_variables(
  variable_values,
  neighbors,
  weights,
  hex_indices = NULL,
  var_names
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable_values}{List of numeric vectors containing variable values for each grid cell}

\item{neighbors}{List of neighbor indices for each order (from compute_topology)}

\item{weights}{List containing center_weight and neighbor_weights for each order}

\item{hex_indices}{Vector of hexagon indices to process (default: all cells)}

\item{var_names}{Character vector of variable names}
}
\value{
List containing smoothing results for each variable with the following components:
  \itemize{
    \item raw: Weighted average of center cell and all neighbors
    \item neighbors_Nst: Mean of neighbors at order N
    \item weighted_combined: Weighted average of center cell and all neighbors
  }
}
\description{
This function applies spatial smoothing to variables using a hexagonal grid topology.
It can be used independently after data extraction, or as part of the complete workflow.
The function automatically uses the C++ implementation when available and falls back to R if needed.

\examples{
# After creating a grid and computing topology
# grid_sf <- create_grid(study_area, cell_size = 10000)
# topology <- compute_topology(grid_sf, neighbor_orders = 3)  # 3 orders

# Extract your variables (example)
# variable_values <- list(
#   ndvi = c(0.5, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 0.3),
#   elevation = c(100, 120, 90, 140, 80)
# )

# Apply smoothing with N orders
# smoothing_results <- smooth_variables(
#   variable_values = variable_values,
#   neighbors = topology$neighbors,
#   weights = topology$weights,
#   var_names = c("ndvi", "elevation")
# )
}
